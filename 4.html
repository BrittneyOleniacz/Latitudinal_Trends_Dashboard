                <h2>Materials & Methods</h1>
                <h3>Specimen Procurement</h2>
                <p>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) has a substantial holding of Raritan amber and has provided a collection of 45 spider inclusions on loan for this study. A private collector, Ralph Johnson, of the Monmouth Amateur Paleontological Society (MAPS), provided and additional 13 spider specimens in Raritan amber for use in this study. After this study concludes, the New Jersey State Museum (NJSM) will accession and store the MAPS specimens for perpetual study (Johnson & Perris, pers. comm. 2019). </p>
                <h3>Conservation</h2>  
                <p>The specimen loaned from AMNH was embedded in epoxy by Nascimbene in 2011 to prevent the amber from disintegrating. The MAPS collection specimens were collected in the 1980s and kept in a basement with fluctuating humidity and temperature, compromising the integrity of the amber (Johnson, pers. comm. 2017; Biscula et al. 2012). However, through conservation efforts, the specimen has been revived. The conservation procedures outlined by Nascimbene & Silverstein (2000) and Biscula et al. (2012) were used, except for curing the epoxy under vacuum, since found to be unnecessary (Nascimbene, pers. comm. 2019). </p>
                <h3>Microscopy, Imaging, and Illustrating</h2> 
                <p>Observing spider inclusions requires magnification; this study uses a Leica M205C stereomicroscope with an incident light source. The use of a camera lucida to sketch specimens helps record diagnostic features (e.g., eyes, spinnerets, claws, trichobothria). The spider inclusions are photographed with a Canon EOS 5D MkII with DSLR assistant software. The three-dimensional nature of the amber and inclusion requires multiple images at different focal points to be aligned and stacked using Adobe Photoshop software (Selden 2014; Selden & Penney 2017). This method produces an image with the entire specimen in focus. The stacked images will be combined with the rough sketches in Adobe Illustrator to produce a digitally rendered illustration. This method is suitable for identifying most specimens to at least the family-level, but some specimens will require advanced imaging. </p>        
                <h3>Advanced Imaging</h2>
                <p>Despite the advantage of working with three-dimensional specimens, identifying specimens within amber can be challenging when the amber is deformed, and the orientation of the inclusion obstructs diagnostic features. Fortunately, advance imaging techniques can provide a clear view of the specimen and prove useful in paleontology to visualize distorted specimens (Penney 2013; Penney et al. 2007; Penney et al. 2012; Selden & Penney 2017). Additionally, to provide exhaustive diagnoses, potential new taxa should be scanned.  Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, though more affordable, can cause irreparable darkening of the amber; therefore, computed tomography is the preferred method (Grimaldi pers. comm. 2019). Computed tomographic imaging will take place at The University of Kansas and The University of Texas-Austin. Each specimen is likely to take about three hours of scanning depending on the location of the specimen within the amber nodule and will require up to an hour of raw-data reconstruction (Maisano pers. comm. 2019). Raw data is then segmented and processed using open-scoure softwares. The segmentation of one specimen can easily take 20 hours, though time-consuming, the final images are worthwhile. </p>

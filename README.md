# Visualizing Latitudinal Trends

## Background
OBJECTIVE: Data is more powerful when we share it with others!
TASK: Create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

ORGANIZATION: Create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:
* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page
  * Include a sidebar containing preview images of each plot whereas clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Must contain all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Hint: Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * Don't forget to consider different screen sizes. The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:  
  * Using a bootstrap component, display a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

Navigation: The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots ["Navigation Menu" section](#navigation-menu) (notice the background color change).

DEMPLOYMENT: the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.

=======
* You may use the [weather data](Resources/cities.csv) or choose another dataset. Alternatively, you may use the included [cities dataset](Resources/cities.csv) and pull the images from the [assets folder](Resources/assets).
* You must use Bootstrap. This includes using the Bootstrap `navbar` component for the header on every page, the bootstrap table component for the data page, and the Bootstrap grid for responsiveness on the comparison page.

* You must deploy your website to GitHub pages, with the website working on a live, publicly accessible URL as a result.

* Be sure your website works at all window widths/sizes.

### Bonuses
* Use a different dataset! The requirements above still hold, but make it your own.
* Use a Bootstrap theme to customize your website. You may use a tool like [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/). Make it look snazzy, give it some attitude. If using this, be sure you also meet all of the requirements listed above.
* Add extra visualizations! The more comparisons the better, right?
* Use meaningful glyphicons next to links in the header.
* Have visualization navigation on every visualizations page with an active state. See the screenshots below.
